### My script to install all that i need

This is my repository i use to install everything and set up archlinux to cybersecurity and programming studies, i want to increase some features yet though. I do not recommend to run it in your machine because there are some hardcoded configuration to my person, but you can clone and customize it for you if you want to.

The main file is the `install.sh` you can easily understand the entire code by reading it and seeing the other scripts it calls during the execution
